This driver consists of both a high level driver which exposes the following abstracted functionality\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Starting / Stopping continuous data capture.
\end{DoxyItemize}

And will expose the following functionality in future\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Retrieving the number of available channels
\item Configuring the input channels.
\item Enabling / disabling current sources.
\item Setting / Getting GPIO levels.
\end{DoxyItemize}

And a low level driver which is called by the high level driver to set the appropriate register values in the ADS1299.

{\bfseries{Note}} The low level driver does not and will not expose the complete functionality of the ADS1299 Registers, and will not be the most optimised solution e.\+g. writing multiple sequential registers at the same time is not intended to be implemented.\hypertarget{md_lib_ads1299_driver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Inheritance}\label{md_lib_ads1299_driver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
The high level \char`\"{}ads1299\+Driver\char`\"{} class inherits from the EEGData\+Producer base class and overrides the \char`\"{}\+Get\+Latest\+Sample\char`\"{} function.

This allows the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_data_flow_controller}{Data\+Flow\+Controller}} class to use it as one of it\textquotesingle{}s possible sources of EMG data.
